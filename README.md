We'll meet up in Pune, India and hack on Arduinos, Rasberry Pis, quadcopters, robots, and any other gizmos that need more input.

The event is planned in first quarter of 2021, inviting all enthusiasts to join US in hands on non-sim hackathon and coding challenges. You will get to learn new tweaks of Arduino and some more on Sphero.

See you there!
